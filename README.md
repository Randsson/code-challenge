### Description and general information


### Requirements


### Endpoints and expected behavior



At this point, if I request `/compute`, the JSON return should have the data:

Important: 
- All `/store` data existing until the `/compute` call should be flushed after computing.
- Make sure to cover your code (test suite).
- You should submit a PR not late 5 days after fork this repository.
- You may use any ruby framework or lib of your preference. This code should be concise, small and well tested. We recommend small framerworks like `sinatra`, `grape`, `rails-api` and so on. Please, don't create a full rails application.
